# create_playlist_with_ai
This project uses the OpenAI API to generate custom Spotify playlists based on a user-provided prompt. The application is built with Node.js, Express, and integrates the Spotify API for creating and managing playlists. It can be used as a base for AI and music projects or simply as a tool for discovering new playlists based on custom descriptions.
